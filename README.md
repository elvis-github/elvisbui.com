## Personal website project for Elvis Bui
### Author: Elvis Bui
---
Here is the open-source code for my personal website that I am building over time as I properly learn web development
through [Udemy](http://www.udemy.com/) and [Colt Steele's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrqAGUPPMOdo0jfQ6grikZw) ["The Web Developer Bootcamp"](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/).

**This website is currently a huge WiP and is worked on when I have free time and ideas to develop it. The most upto date version of the website will be in the repository while the domain will have the "production" version.**

Visit the website here: <http://elvisbui.com/>

Technologies Used/Included So Far:
1. HTML, CSS, & JavaScript
2. Bootstrap 4.0
3. jQuery 3.4.1
